# Changelog — cokacdir

## 0.4.97 — 2026-04-25

- **`/queue` OFF behavior changed: reject → redirect.** Previously, sending a message while the AI was busy with `/queue` OFF returned "AI request in progress" and dropped the message. Now, that same message cancels the in-progress task and is processed immediately on the same session — natural mid-task redirects ("아니 그거 말고 X 해줘") just work. Plain text, `;text`, `/query <text>`, and captioned file uploads trigger redirect; slash commands (`/help`, `/start`, …) and shell commands (`!cmd`) keep the existing rejection so an unrelated command never kills a long-running task. If a second redirect arrives while the first is still cancelling, the latest one wins (replaces the pending target). `/queue` ON (the default) is unchanged — messages still queue FIFO. `/stop`/`/stopall` semantics are unchanged. Resolves [#34](https://github.com/kstost/cokacdir/issues/34).

---

## 0.4.92 — 2026-04-17

- **`/loop` now works with Codex and OpenCode**, not just Claude. After each turn the bot still asks the AI to judge whether the task is fully done and re-injects remaining work until it is, but the verification mechanics are now provider-specific: Claude uses its native `--fork-session`; Codex replays a full-fidelity session archive into an isolated `codex exec --ephemeral` call that never touches the original rollout file; OpenCode uses `opencode run --session <id> --fork --agent plan`. Gemini still falls back with a clear message.
- New full-fidelity session archive at `~/.cokacdir/ai_sessions_full/{session_id}.json` — parallel to the existing truncated UI summary. Preserves all text, tool arguments, tool results, timestamps, model info, and token usage for Claude/Codex/Gemini/OpenCode sessions. Used by the Codex verifier; written automatically alongside the summary.
- The `/loop` verification progress indicator is now an animated 🔍/🔎 spinner that cycles letter-by-letter while the verifier runs.
- Fixed: `/model` help listed Opus as 4.6; now correctly shows Opus 4.7.

---

## 0.4.89 — 2026-04-15

- New `/setendhook <message>` command — set a custom notification message that is sent as a separate message whenever AI processing completes. Useful as an alert when waiting for long responses. Use `/setendhook_clear` to remove. Applies to all processing types: normal AI responses, shell commands, scheduled tasks, and bot-to-bot messages. Not sent when the request is cancelled via `/stop`.

---

## 0.4.88 — 2026-04-15

- **File copy now preserves timestamps.** All copy operations (single file, directory recursive, paste) now retain the original modification and access times using the `filetime` crate. Directory timestamps are set after contents are fully copied to avoid being overwritten by child writes.
- **Codex streaming: improved tool display.** Codex `file_change` events now emit a ToolResult summary listing each changed file and its kind (add/update/delete). `collab_tool_call` events display human-readable prompts for spawn/send/followup tools and extract agent response messages from `agents_states` on wait/close. `web_search` events show the actual query text (or expanded queries) instead of raw JSON. `command_execution` error detection now also checks the `status` field for "failed"/"declined".
- Fixed: Codex Collab tool display showed redundant text like "Agent wait: wait" instead of "Agent: wait" for tools whose display string equalled the tool name.
- Fixed: Codex web_search with an empty `action.queries` array would lose the original query text, showing a bare "Search" label instead of the query.

---

## 0.4.85 — 2026-04-11

- **OpenCode background tasks now actually complete.** When using the oh-my-opencode plugin, messages that dispatched a background task (e.g. "I'll report back when it's done") previously left the turn hanging forever because the one-shot `opencode run` process was torn down as soon as the parent session went idle, interrupting the background sub-session mid-flight. The OpenCode adapter was reworked to spawn `opencode serve` per turn, drive the session over HTTP + SSE, and wait until the parent session, all child sessions, and all todos are idle before shutting down — so background task notifications make it back to the user and the final answer is delivered end-to-end.
- Fixed: OpenCode `--session <id>` was silently ignored when combined with `--continue`, causing cross-session routing into whichever root session was most recent. `--continue` is no longer passed alongside `--session`.
- Fixed: OpenCode responses that ended with a legitimate non-"stop" finish reason (`length`, `content-filter`, `error`) were misreported as "empty response" errors. These are now treated as terminal like OpenCode itself does.
- Fixed: a recoverable OpenCode error (e.g. `ContextOverflowError` that auto-compaction recovers from) could poison an otherwise successful turn. Error events are now tentative until the turn ends and are only surfaced when no usable output arrived.
- Fixed: OpenCode calls with a stale `--session` id used to exit cleanly with an empty stdout while writing `NotFoundError` to stderr, surfacing as a confusing "empty response". The stderr message is now reported as the actual error.
- Improved: OpenCode empty-response diagnostics now include the last finish reason, event/tool counters, last event type, output-token count, and exit code, making it possible to tell at a glance why a turn produced no text.
- The legacy `opencode run` path is preserved and can be forced with `COKACDIR_OPENCODE_LEGACY=1` as a rollback escape hatch.

---

## 0.4.84 — 2026-04-10

- Fixed: streaming AI responses could panic with "byte index is not a char boundary" when a multi-byte character (emoji, CJK text) happened to straddle the rolling-placeholder threshold or when `full_response` was replaced by an error message mid-stream. All nine `full_response` slicing sites across the text, schedule, and bot-to-bot polling loops now floor to a valid UTF-8 char boundary and reset `last_confirmed_len` if it no longer points at a valid boundary in the current response.

---

## 0.4.83 — 2026-04-10

- New `/envvars` command — dump all environment variables visible to the bot process (bot-owner only). Useful for verifying which overrides are active. ⚠ Exposes sensitive values with no redaction — use in a 1:1 chat only.
- New startup loader for `~/.cokacdir/.env.json` — values from this file are injected into the process environment at launch and take priority over shell-exported values. Supports string, number, and boolean values at the root JSON object.
- New `COKAC_CLAUDE_PATH` environment variable — override the path to the Claude CLI binary instead of relying on `which claude` / `SearchPathW`.
- New `COKAC_CODEX_PATH` environment variable — same as above for the Codex CLI binary.
- New `COKAC_FILE_ATTACH_THRESHOLD` environment variable — tune the byte threshold (default 8192) at which long AI responses switch to `.txt` file attachment mode, introduced in 0.4.81.
- Documented the pre-existing `COKAC_GEMINI_PATH`, `COKAC_OPENCODE_PATH`, and `COKACDIR_DEBUG` environment variables. See the new "Environment Variables" guide in the docs for the full reference.
- Fixed: CLI-binary path resolution for Claude, Codex, Gemini, and Opencode now verifies the resolved path actually exists on disk before returning it. Previously, a stale `which` result or a `COKAC_*_PATH` pointing at a deleted file would be accepted and then fail later at spawn time. The multi-panel file manager's CLI availability check was hardened the same way.
- Fixed: when switching to a previously-saved workspace, a stale `session_id` from the prior workspace could leak into the newly-restored session. The in-memory `session.session_id` is now explicitly cleared before restoration.

---

## 0.4.82 — 2026-04-03

- New `/usechrome` command — toggle Chrome browser tool (`--chrome`) for Claude CLI per chat.

---

## 0.4.81 — 2026-04-03

- **Very long AI responses are now sent as a file attachment** instead of flooding the chat with many consecutive messages. Responses over ~8,000 characters are delivered as a downloadable `.txt` file.
- This applies everywhere: normal responses, stopped/cancelled responses, scheduled tasks, and bot-to-bot messages.

---

## 0.4.79 — 2026-04-02

- Updated the built-in schedule documentation to be simpler and more user-friendly.

---

## 0.4.78 — 2026-04-02

- **The bot now knows how to answer "how to" questions** — built-in documentation (14 help guides) is deployed to `~/.cokacdir/docs/` on startup and the AI references them when you ask for help.
- Fixed Discord `<@ID>` mentions being passed as raw text — they are now shown as readable `@username` format.
- Removed outdated internal design documents.

---

## 0.4.77 — 2026-04-02

- **Discord bot support added.** You can now use Discord bot tokens with `--ccserver`. Token type (Telegram vs Discord) is auto-detected, or you can prefix with `discord:` explicitly.
- Telegram and Discord bots can run simultaneously in the same server.
- All existing features (AI chat, file upload, schedules, group collaboration) work on Discord.
- Co-work guidelines for multi-bot group chats can now be customized by editing `~/.cokacdir/prompt/cowork.md`.

---

## 0.4.76 — 2026-03-31

- **You can now upload videos, voice messages, audio, GIFs, and video notes** — previously only documents and photos were supported.
- **No more `/start` required** — sending a message or file automatically creates a workspace if none exists.
- New `/greeting` command to switch between a compact and full startup message.
- Files with duplicate names are automatically renamed (e.g., `file(1).txt`) instead of being overwritten.
- Files larger than 20 MB are rejected with a clear error message.
- Shell commands are now properly blocked while the AI is busy.

---

## 0.4.75 — 2026-03-29

## 0.4.72 — 2026-03-29

- Changed the cancel command format from `/stop ID` to `/stop_ID` so it works as a tappable link in Telegram.

---

## 0.4.71 — 2026-03-29

- **Message queue**: Messages sent while the AI is busy are now automatically queued (up to 20) and processed in order. No more "busy" rejections.
- New `/stopall` command — cancels the current AI request and clears all queued messages.
- New `/stop_ID` command — cancel a specific queued message by its ID.
- New `/queue` command — toggle queue mode on/off (on by default).
